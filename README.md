## About

This template was created for the Linked & Launch Workshop by [Women in Computer Science at UBC](https://ubcwics.com) to help students quickly set up a personal website. A personal website is more than just a portfolioâ€”it reflects your identity, projects, and interests beyond LinkedIn and resumes.

Check out the template here: https://selinuz.github.io/personalWebsiteTemplate.github.io/

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selinuz/personalWebsiteTemplate.github.io.git
```

**Important:** Rename the repository to `your-github-username.github.io` for GitHub Pages to work correctly.

### 2. Customize Your Site

- Edit `index.html` for content.
- Modify `style.css` for colors and layout.
- Add projects, work experience, and personalize it with unique sections.

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Push your changes to GitHub.
- Go to **Settings > Pages** in project.
- Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (e.g., `main` or `master`).
- Click **Save**.

Your site will be live at `https://your-github-username.github.io`.

## Next Steps

- Add animations or interactive elements.
- Convert to React for more scalability.
- Use it as part of your personal brand on resumes and LinkedIn.
